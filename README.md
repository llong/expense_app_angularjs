# AngularJS Expense Application

This application was built as a coding challenge for a front end developer position. The challenge was to build an expense tracking application using AngularJS with no backend. I built the app with some sample data coming from app/js/demoData.js. This demo data can be disabled by commenting out line 8 on app/js/controllers.js.

## Running App
To run the app you can either run a server within the public folder (or drag foler into your own project) or you can install brunch (npm install -g brunch) and run "brunch watch --server" in your terminal.

## Tech Stack

 - AngularJS 1.6
 - Brunch Task Runner/bundler
 - Bootstrap 4 Sass
